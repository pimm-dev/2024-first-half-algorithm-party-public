The \\bf{Tree} that Root manages is an acyclic graph, with $N$ vertices to show how well it's managed. \n\n\nOne day, Young, an evil villain who has always been jealous of Kim's beautiful \\bf{Tree}, sets it on fire! In order for Kim to preserve the \\bf{tree} as intact as possible, he needs to duplicate as much of the data stored in each vertex of the \\bf{Tree} as possible before the \\bf{Tree} burns up and disappears.\n\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Initially, Young burned vertex $A$, and Kim is standing at vertex $B$. $(A \\neq B)$\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\nKim can choose to perform one of the following actions on the unburned vertex.:\n\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\bf{DUPLICATE}: Kim duplicates the data from the current vertex. This behavior does not consume any time. However, data cannot be duplicated again from a vertex that has already been duplicated.\n  \\item \\bf{MOVE}: Kim moves to one of the unburned vertices connected to the current vertex.\n  \\item \\bf{WAIT}: Kim waits at the current vertex without moving.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\nIf Kim chooses \\bf{MOVE} or \\bf{WAIT}, the fire will spread to the vertices for the duration of the action. In other words, any unburned vertices that are connected to a burned vertex will be burned.\n\n\nIf Kim ends up on a burned vertex, he will give up trying to save the \\bf{Tree} and escape from it. Your job is to find the maximum number of vertices he can duplicate in the \\bf{Tree} before he escapes, among all possible cases, and tell him.\n\n\nLet's help Kim stop Young's plan!","authorLogin":"j0dO","language":"english","timeLimit":1000,"output":"Among all possible cases, print the maximum number of vertices that can be duplicated in the \\bf{Tree} before Kim escapes.","inputFile":"stdin","outputFile":"stdout","input":"The first line of input contains an integer $N$ $(2 \\leq N \\leq 50000)$.\nThe next $N-1$ lines contains two connected vertices in the \\bf{Tree}.\nThe last line contains the burned vertex $A$ and the vertex $B$ where the Kim is located.","authorName":"영도 정","sampleTests":[{"output":"3\n","input":"8\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n5 4\n4 6\n7 6\n6 8\n5 4\n","inputFile":"example.01","outputFile":"example.01.a"},{"output":"5\n","input":"13\n10 11\n6 7\n7 11\n7 3\n1 3\n3 4\n12 8\n8 4\n4 5\n5 2\n5 9\n9 13\n13 7\n","inputFile":"example.02","outputFile":"example.02.a"},{"output":"1\n","input":"3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n","inputFile":"example.03","outputFile":"example.03.a"}],"name":"Savior of Tree","interaction":null,"memoryLimit":1048576000,"tutorial":""}
